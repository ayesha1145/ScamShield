# ScamShield 🛡️  
**AI-powered hybrid fraud detection system that identifies and explains scams in real time.  
Built with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB — combining rule-based logic with machine learning.  
Designed for transparency, accuracy, and real-world digital safety at scale.**  

ScamShield is designed to detect, explain, and prevent digital scams — combining human logic and machine learning to make online communication safer for everyone.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Scam and phishing messages are increasingly common across SMS, email, and online chat platforms.  
Traditional spam filters fail to **explain why** something is dangerous, leaving users confused and vulnerable.  

---

## 💡 Solution  
ScamShield uses a **three-layer hybrid detection system**:  
1. **Rule-Based Detection** — Recognizes scam-related keywords (urgency, impersonation, fake rewards).  
2. **Blacklist Matching** — Checks against known scam domains, numbers, and phrases stored in MongoDB.  
3. **AI Classification** — Uses a trained Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF to catch new scam patterns.

Each message receives a **risk score (0–100)** with a clear label:  
🟢 Safe | 🟡 Suspicious | 🔴 Dangerous
